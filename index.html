                <p> Sri Lanka, which is located in the Indian Ocean and is known as the "Pearl of the Indian Ocean" for its 
                    beauty and historical significance, is one of the smallest islands rich in natural resources and beauty.
                     Sri Lanka, which is classified as an Asian country, has an average temperature of 82 degrees Fahrenheit 
                     to 86 degrees Fahrenheit, with temperatures rarely exceeding 90 degrees Fahrenheit which is to be one of
                      the main reasons to visit sri lanka!!!</p>

                    <h2>SPICES</h2>
                    <p>Given that Sri Lanka is known as the "spice island," it's no wonder that spices have had a significant influence
                         on local taste buds and cuisines, resulting in rich flavor profiles and aromatic qualities. Many spices are
                          abundantly cultivated in the local ground due to the ideal climatic conditions in Sri Lanka.
                          <br> Spices like as 
                            <ul>
                                <li>cinnamon</li>

                    <div class="srilanka-1-image arts"></div>
                    <h2>ARTS AND CRAFTS</h2>
                    <p>We think that all types of art and crafts, such as paintings, architecture, and sculptures, originally originated
                         in religious streams in Sri Lanka, which has a comparatively religiously based society. Hundreds of thousands of
                          temples include a vast collection of paintings and fine arts.

                    <h2>TRAVEL</h2>
                    <p>Because of the covid-19 pandemic, travel is limited to travelers who have health and covid-19 insurance.
                         In other words, depending on your covid-19 vaccination status, admission requirements to Sri Lanka are restricted. 
                         Despite the travel limitations, Sri Lankan tourism bureaus have made every effort to make your trip one to remember.</p>

                        <h2>CUISINES</h2>
                        <p>As previously said, Sri Lanka's spices lead us to the most intriguing aspect of the country's cuisine:
                             its richly flavored cuisines. Spiciness and natural ingredients are constantly present in Sri Lankan
                              cuisine. Sri Lankan cuisine is never boring. Everything is prepared in a healthy, spicy manner.</p>

                        <h2>TEA CULTURE</h2>
                        <p>Sri Lanka is known as one of the world's largest tea growers, and the sector is now a separate and large-scale
                             business in the country. Sri Lankans are most likely to drink at least three cups of tea every day, and any 
                             visitor to our home is provided tea as part of our culture, demonstrating how great tea is in Sri Lanka.</p>

                        <p>In Sri Lanka, Sinhala is known as the mother tongue. Apart from Tamil and English, it is also the most widely 
                            spoken language in the country.When it comes to religion, the Sri Lankan community is divided into four distinct 
                            groups: 
                            <ol>
