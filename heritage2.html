                    <p>Dambulla Cave Temple, commonly known as the Golden Temple, is a cave temple in Dambulla, Matara district Sri Lanka. 
                        Dambulla, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is situated in the Matale area of Sri Lanka. This cave, which was originally
                         a natural cave, has been restored through time to become one of the largest Buddhist complexes in the southern 
                         and southeast Asian region. To put it another way, this cave has undergone multiple modifications since the 18th 
                         century to arrive at its current state. The golden temple, also known as Dambulla cave temple, is notable in the
                          Buddhist world for its long link with active Buddhist ritual activities and pilgrimage for more than thousand years.<br><br>
                          The temple is made up of five caverns that have been turned into shrine chambers.
